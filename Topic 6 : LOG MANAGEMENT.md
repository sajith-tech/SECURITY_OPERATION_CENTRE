# Log Management

## What is Log Management?

**Log management** is the process of collecting, storing, analyzing, and disposing of log data generated by computer systems, networks, and security devices. It is a critical part of IT operations and cybersecurity, helping organizations detect incidents, troubleshoot issues, and meet compliance requirements.

## Why is Log Management important?

* Helps detect security incidents and anomalies.
* Provides evidence for investigations and forensic analysis.
* Supports compliance with standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
* Improves operational visibility and troubleshooting.

## Key components of Log Management

### 1. **Log Collection**

* Gathering logs from different sources such as servers, applications, firewalls, routers, and endpoints.
* Can be done using agents or through centralized logging protocols like Syslog.

### 2. **Log Aggregation**

* Combining logs into a centralized storage location.
* Simplifies analysis and ensures no logs are missed.

### 3. **Log Parsing and Normalization**

* Converting logs from different formats into a common structure.
* Helps in better correlation and searching.

### 4. **Log Storage and Retention**

* Storing logs securely for a required period (as per legal or business needs).
* Ensures logs are available for future analysis and audits.

### 5. **Log Analysis**

* Examining logs to identify trends, detect anomalies, and spot security incidents.
* Can include automated analysis using SIEM tools or manual review.

### 6. **Log Monitoring and Alerting**

* Continuously monitoring logs for suspicious activities.
* Generating alerts when predefined conditions are met.

### 7. **Log Archiving and Disposal**

* Moving older logs to archive storage or securely disposing of them after the retention period.

## Common sources of logs

* Operating systems (Windows Event Logs, Linux syslogs)
* Security devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus)
* Applications (web servers, databases)
* Cloud services and SaaS applic
